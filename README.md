# cat-paw

## This is what web animations are used for, right?

I wasn't really paying attention during Jenn's talk so I can't say for sure. But there was animation and cats.

This is a web component that adds a floating, disembodied cat paw using CSS Keyframe Animations and Polymer.

Also, this repo proves Web Components are finally ready for production. [Eat it, Telerik][webcomp].

## Creepify your site in 4 steps

1. Setup Polymer. Easiest approach, use [yo-polymer][polymer].
2. Install cat-paw using Bower: `bower install polymer-cat-paw --save`
3. Import it: `<link rel="import" href="bower_components/polymer-cat-paw/cat-paw.html">`
4. Use it: `<cat-paw>`.
